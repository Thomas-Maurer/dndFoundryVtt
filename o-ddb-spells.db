You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>\r\n<p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>\r\n<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\r\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\r\n<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose&nbsp;<em>explosive runes</em>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<em>spell glyph</em>.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Explosive Runes.</strong></em>&nbsp;When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Spell Glyph.</strong></em>&nbsp;You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong>&nbsp;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an&nbsp;<em>explosive runes</em>&nbsp;glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a&nbsp;<em>spell glyph</em>, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the&nbsp;glyph of warding.</p>","chat":"<p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>\r\n<p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>\r\n<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\r\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\r\n<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose&nbsp;<em>explosive runes</em>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<em>spell glyph</em>.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Explosive Runes.</strong></em>&nbsp;When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Spell Glyph.</strong></em>&nbsp;You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong>&nbsp;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an&nbsp;<em>explosive runes</em>&nbsp;glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

Red.</strong> The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Orange.</strong> The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Yellow.</strong> The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Green.</strong> The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Blue.</strong> The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Indigo.</strong> On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Violet.</strong> On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>8. Special.</strong> The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.</p>","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook p 267","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":"inst"},"target":{"value":60,"units":"ft","type":"cone"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["10d6","fire"],["10d6","acid"],["10d6","lightning"],["10d6","poison"],["10d6","cold"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"dex","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":7,"school":"evo","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"flags":{"vtta":{"dndbeyond":{"lookup":"classSpell","class":"Wizard","level":20,"spellLevel":7,"spellSlots":{"spell0":{"value":null},"spell1":{"value":4,"max":4},"spell2":{"value":3,"max":3},"spell3":{"value":3,"max":3},"spell4":{"value":3,"max":3},"spell5":{"value":3,"max":3},"spell6":{"value":2,"max":2},"spell7":{"value":2,"max":2},"spell8":{"value":1,"max":1},"spell9":{"value":1,"max":1}},"ability":"int","mod":1,"dc":15,"cantripBoost":false,"overrideDC":false,"tags":["Damage","Control"]}},"betterRolls5e":{"quickVersatile":{"altValue":true}},"obsidian":{"time":{"type":"action","n":1,"react":""},"range":{"type":"self","n":null},"duration":{"type":"instant","n":null},"components":{"v":true,"s":true},"source":{"type":"custom"},"effects":[{"name":"","uuid":"cf8cf7f5-c341-430c-b65f-39f6a2f9e729","components":[{"type":"target","target":"area","count":1,"area":"cone","distance":60,"uuid":"77ec6b07-6df5-462b-84ba-3307a757ed42"},{"type":"damage","calc":"formula","ndice":10,"die":6,"ability":"","bonus":0,"damage":"fir","versatile":false,"uuid":"92349567-736c-449b-8b8e-7fe2e1a8c7eb"},{"type":"damage","calc":"formula","ndice":10,"die":6,"ability":"","bonus":0,"damage":"acd","versatile":false,"uuid":"7dfc401f-1d55-4639-b5ca-47c054937bf3"},{"type":"damage","calc":"formula","ndice":10,"die":6,"ability":"","bonus":0,"damage":"lig","versatile":false,"uuid":"2c0832ab-02a4-41e6-9aeb-20541c209c67"},{"type":"damage","calc":"formula","ndice":10,"die":6,"ability":"","bonus":0,"damage":"psn","versatile":false,"uuid":"7710ac56-95b5-431b-8057-801fcc84debd"},{"type":"damage","calc":"formula","ndice":10,"die":6,"ability":"","bonus":0,"damage":"cld","versatile":false,"uuid":"a16efb8a-dc52-4203-87e9-e28090be0514"},{"type":"save","calc":"formula","fixed":0,"bonus":8,"prof":1,"ability":"spell","target":"dex","effect":"","save":"half","uuid":"8417b37d-ef94-4250-98fa-e223a3c8878e"}]}],"version":10},"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"lookup":"generic","lookupName":"generic","level":null,"castAtLevel":null,"tags":["Damage","Control"]}}},"img":"/systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/needles-royal-3.jpg","effects":[]}
